In the iterative function, just one stack frame is used as the function runs in a loop without the need to make nested calls of itself. 
In the recursive function, a stack frame is created for each nested call until the base case is reached.
In conclusion, the difference between an iterative and a recursive function is that an iterative function only uses one stack frame, while the recursive function uses as many stack frames as the amount of calls made.

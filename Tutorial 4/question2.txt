As for the readability, the recursive function is easier to understand and follow, however debugging may be easier for the iterative function as no nested looping is used in this case.
Regarding stack frame usage, the iterative function just uses one stack frame as there is just one function, meanwhile for the recursive function a new stack frame is created for each recursive call. This means that, especially at larger numbers, significantly more memory is used.
